          <blockquote>
            <p>"First in war, first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen, he was unsurpassed in the humble and enduring scenes of private life. Pious, fair, human, temperate, sincere, uniform, dignified and outstanding. His example was as edifying to all around him, as were the effects of this lasting example ... all right, vice shuddered in his presence and virtue always felt encouraged from his hand. The purity of his private character gave brightness to his public virtues ... Such was the man for which our nation is in mourning."</p>
